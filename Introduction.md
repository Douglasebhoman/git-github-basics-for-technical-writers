## Key Concepts of Git

Git is a version control system that allows you to:

- Track changes in files over time
- Revert to previous versions if necessary
- Collaborate with multiple people without overwriting work
- Maintain a clear history of all changes

### Why It Matters for Technical Writers

Even if you’re not coding, using Git:

- Keeps your documentation organized
- Allows you to experiment without fear of losing content
- Lets you collaborate with developers in their workflow

---

## Understanding GitHub

GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides:

- A place to store your projects online
- Collaboration tools (issues, pull requests)
- Version tracking in a visual interface
- Integration with documentation tools and pipelines

GitHub works hand-in-hand with Git: Git is the engine, GitHub is the cloud workspace.

## Common Documentation Workflows

Technical writers can use Git and GitHub to:

1. **Clone a repository** – copy the project to your computer
2. **Edit documentation** – add or update content
3. **Commit changes** – save updates with a clear message
4. **Push changes** – upload updates to GitHub
5. **Collaborate** – review pull requests or accept contributions from others

Even a simple workflow like this keeps documentation organized and versioned.
